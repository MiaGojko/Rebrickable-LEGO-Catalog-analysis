    "The analysis of available sets and the number of parts is conducted over the period from 1949 to 2025, covering a total of 77 years. An inventory consists of smaller units, identified by inventory_id, each containing one or more parts. Every part available in a given inventory_id is defined by its color, which makes it unique and also determines the time range during which that part is present in the inventory. In addition to the fact that a single inventory_id may contain multiple different types of colored parts, parts of the same color can appear in multiple inventory_ids. This structure enables extensive possibilities for combining and creating new complete sets.\n",

    "The analysis of inventories shows an overall upward trend with periods of stability and eventual saturation. The average number of inventories across the entire period is about 33,900, with values ranging from a minimum of 28,783 in the early 1950s to a maximum of 36,453 in 2004. The standard deviation is relatively low, around 2,000, indicating that most values cluster close to the mean. The sharpest increase occurred in 1957, when inventories rose by more than 3,200 compared to the previous year. After steady growth through the 1980s and 1990s, the series reached its peak in the early 2000s, followed by a plateau where values fluctuate only slightly around 36,300. This statistical profile highlights three phases: initial stability, gradual growth with notable jumps, and a final stage of stagnation, suggesting the system has reached its saturation point in recent decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total parts**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following graph represents the total number of available parts across all inventories per year, meaning that the same part may be counted multiple times if it appears in different inventories. It therefore reflects overall availability rather than the number of unique parts by color.\n",

    "\n",
    "The data on the total number of available parts across all inventories from 1949 to 2025 reveals a long‑term upward trajectory with distinct phases of growth and stabilization. In the early years, values hovered around 407,000, before a sharp increase in 1957 pushed the total close to 700,000. Through the 1960s and 1970s the figures remained relatively stable in the 700,000–720,000 range, while the 1980s saw a gradual rise to about 785,000, which also represents the median of the entire series. From the 1990s onward, growth accelerated, surpassing 900,000 by the end of the decade and crossing the one‑million mark in the early 2000s. The peak was reached in 2024 with 1,283,515 available parts, while the overall average across the period stands at approximately 884,000. The standard deviation of about 285,000 indicate considerable dispersion, reflecting the large jumps in certain years. Taken together, the data highlight phases of stability, periods of strong expansion, and eventual saturation in the most recent decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis shows that in earlier decades the growth in active inventories directly drove the increase in available parts, with both measures rising in parallel. Since the 2000s, however, the number of inventories has remained largely stable, while the total number of parts has continued to grow sharply. This indicates that expansion now comes not from adding more inventories, but from each inventory containing a greater variety and volume of parts, reflecting a shift toward richer and more complex inventories in recent years.\n",

    "The analysis of the average number of parts per inventory from 1949 to 2025 reveals three distinct phases: an initial period of simplicity (14–15 parts), a long era of stability at around 21–23 parts, and a sharp increase beginning in the late 1990s that culminates in a plateau of 34–35 parts from 2005 onward. Descriptive statistics confirm this pattern: the mean is approximately 26 parts, the median 23, the minimum 14, and the maximum 35. With a variance of 47.9 and a standard deviation of 6.9, most values fall within a relatively narrow band around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the total sum and average metrics, both produce nearly identical trend lines: a sharp rise in 1957, decades of stability, another surge around the 2000s, and eventual saturation. The difference lies only in scale: total sum reflects the total availability of parts across all inventories, while average represents the typical complexity of a single inventory. Because the number of inventories per year did not change dramatically, both measures track the same underlying dynamics. This parallel confirms that the observed trend is genuine and consistent, regardless of whether it is measured in aggregate or normalized form.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inventories linked to sets**  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to determine the number of parts available for a given inventory_id, and by using the same inventory_id it is also possible to define which sets those parts are available for. In order to finally conclude what kind of ratio exists between the number of parts available to sets that are in stock within an inventory in a given year, a visualization has been created. Since no set linked to an inventory containing parts in quantity was created before 1969, that year serves as the starting point. Although an inventory_id may have existed with available parts in earlier years, the corresponding set did not yet exist, making their relationship during that period irrelevant to examine.  \n",

    "The line chart illustrates the evolution of the average number of available parts per year, together with the minimum, maximum, and standard deviation values. From 1969 through the late 1970s, the data remain flat at a minimal level, reflecting a very limited availability of parts. A sharp increase occurs in 1980, when both the average and variability rise significantly, with the maximum reaching 24 parts and the standard deviation exceeding 10. This marks the beginning of a more dynamic period in the 1980s and 1990s, where averages stabilize around 6–8 parts but with occasional spikes, such as in 1997 when the maximum jumps to 63 and the standard deviation peaks at over 14.\n",
    "In the 2000s, the average values decline slightly and variability narrows, with maximum values generally between 51 and 72 parts. From 2010 onward, the trend shows relative stability, with averages around 3–4 parts and standard deviations gradually decreasing, indicating a more consistent distribution. The only notable exception is in 2024–2025, when the maximum rises sharply to 94 parts, temporarily increasing variability again.\n",
    "Overall, the visualization highlights three phases: an initial period of negligible values, a middle phase of growth and volatility, and a recent phase of stabilization with occasional outliers. This suggests that while the system matured into a more predictable state, rare spikes in maximum availability still occur, influencing the reliability of the overall distribution.    \n",

    "The data show very few sets with available parts until the mid‑1990s. A sharp surge appears in 1997–2004, peaking at 27 sets in 1998 and staying high through the early 2000s. After that, values fluctuate at lower levels, with occasional spikes such as 12 sets in 2023 and 11 in 2025. Overall, the trend moves from minimal early activity, to a late‑1990s boom, and then to moderate but steady levels in recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, sets have become increasingly complex. From minimal part counts in the early decades, the late 1990s and early 2000s brought a sharp surge in parts per set, reflecting richer inventories. Since then, the trend has stabilized at higher averages, with occasional spikes, showing that modern sets consistently contain more parts than earlier ones."

The drop from 19 to 13 in 1999 represents a slight pullback from the peak, but still a much higher level than the early 1990s, when only 2–5 themes were added annually.

    "**Color registry overview**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The LEGO color registry currently contains 273 distinct colors. Each color is defined by a unique ID, its name, RGB code, transparency status, the years during which it was available, and the number of parts and sets in which it appears. The very first colors were introduced in 1949, and new ones continue to be added today, showing how the palette has evolved alongside LEGO’s growth as a company.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Color palette in use each year evolution timeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of the LEGO color palette mirrored the evolution of themes and their sets. As themes expanded, the palette of available colors had to grow as well. Much like the trajectory of themes, the palette’s growth can be traced through three distinct phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"num_of_colors_in_use_each_year_bar.png\"  />\n",
    "</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "In the early years, up until the 1990s, the palette consisted of a modest range of 6 to 30 colors. During the 1990s a strong surge began, culminating in 2004 with a peak of 126 colors available. After this maximum, the palette contracted until around the 2010s, when it stabilized at roughly 75 colors.\n",
    "Comparing the first half of the observed period with the second half reveals a striking difference in the number of colors available each year. Statistics confirm this: across the entire timeline the average number of colors was 44, with a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 126. The high variance of 1004.7 and a standard deviation of 31.7 show that the spectrum was highly variable. However, the final stabilization phase around 2010 falls within a reliable interval and no longer deviates beyond the average plus one standard deviation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key attributes of each color is its transparency. In line with market trends, the palette has shifted over time, and transparency provides a useful lens for tracking this development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"transp_num_of_colors_in_use_each_year_bar.png\"/>\n",
    "</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the entire period, non‑transparent colors dominate. Their growth curve closely mirrors the overall availability of colors regardless of transparency. At the very beginning, only non‑transparent colors existed, so for the first two decades they were absolutely dominant. Across the full timeline, non‑transparent colors average 34, with a standard deviation of 23.85. The median of 22 falls in the lower half of the confidence interval, while the minimum of 6 and maximum of 102 lie outside it.\n",
    "Transparent colors, by contrast, are present in much smaller numbers but show clear growth. Their count nearly quadrupled in the second half of the timeline compared to the first. With an average of 10 colors and a standard deviation of 8.4, the minimum of 1 and maximum of 28 fall outside the confidence interval, while the median of 7 sits in the lower half of the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**New colors in color palette each year**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the palette to expand over time and for more colors to become available in a given period, it was necessary to introduce colors with new specifications. As previously shown, the very first colors were nontransparent, and there were only ten of them.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the first half of the palette’s development, the range did not expand significantly. However, with the growth and evolution of the 1990s, a notable increase in the introduction of new colors occurred, and the palette began to expand year after year. An interesting fluctuation appeared in 1963, when 29 new colors were introduced. That was the highest number in any single year. There are years in which no new colors were added, while in years when they were, the average number introduced was five. With a median of three and a standard deviation of 6.49, the minimum of one color falls within the confidence interval, whereas the maximum of twenty-nine does not.\n",

    "\n",
    "When it comes to the ratio of transparency in colors, the data shows that nontransparent colors were overwhelmingly dominant throughout the timeline. They appear consistently from the very beginning, with 10 introduced in 1949, and their curve of introduction mirrors the overall expansion of the palette. On average, years with new nontransparent colors saw about 6 introductions, with a median of 3, a minimum of 1, and a striking maximum of 29 in 1963, which stands out as a clear outlier. The relatively high standard deviation of 6.5 confirms the variability of their expansion.\n",
    "Transparent colors, by contrast, were introduced later and in much smaller numbers. The first appeared in 1954, and while they remained rare for decades, their presence gradually increased in the second half of the timeline. Peaks occurred in 2003 and 2005 (5 each) and in 2020 (6), marking their strongest years. Statistically, years with transparent introductions averaged about 2 colors, with a median of 1, a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 6, alongside a standard deviation of 1.6, reflecting their relatively stable but low‑volume growth.\n",
    "Overall, the comparison highlights that nontransparent colors carried the bulk of LEGO’s palette evolution, with large fluctuations and occasional surges, while transparent colors played a supplementary role, gradually expanding but never surpassing the dominance of nontransparent shades.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from usage and the creation of colors, another important factor is popularity. Over time, the nontransparent black color (RGB = 05131D) has been the one with the highest number of parts and sets created in it. However, although black has the most parts and sets in the registry, it is not necessarily the most popular color used in every single year. In fact, in each year the most popular color used for parts is the nontransparent white color (RGB = FFFFFF).\n",

    "From this we know that white is the most popular color overall, but the following graph also shows which other colors appear in the palette when looking at popularity across the years.

At popularity levels 2–5, it is still nontransparent colors that appear, and these were already introduced in LEGO’s very first year, 1949. An unusually defined color appears at the second level of popularity, representing the color registered as 9999, which in the color registry refers to No Color / Any Color. \n",

    "**About Labubu**\n",
    "\n",
    "Labubu is a mischievous cartoon character created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, first introduced through his illustrated series The Monsters. Today, Labubu is produced as a collectible toy by Pop Mart, a Chinese company renowned for its blind‑box designer figures. The character appears in numerous color variations and themed editions, making it especially appealing to collectors who value visual diversity and surprise formats. In recent years, Labubu has become a global phenomenon, generating hundreds of millions in revenue for Pop Mart. Rare figures have reached resale prices of more than $2,000, and the fan base spans Asia, Europe, and the United States, with a core audience of young adults aged 25 to 34, particularly women. The blind‑box format is central to Labubu’s success, encouraging repeat purchases and building excitement around limited releases and rare variants. The combination of emotional design, collectibility and social media visibility has made Labubu one of the most successful designer toy lines of the past decade.\n",

    "**Collaboration between LEGO and Labubu (Pop Mart)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "A collaboration between companies LEGO and Pop Mart for the product Labubu would be a natural extension of LEGO’s proven strategy of partnering with pop culture icons and designer brands. LEGO has already demonstrated success with character‑driven formats such as BrickHeadz, which stylize popular figures like Mickey Mouse and Harry Potter, and the Minifigures Series, which relies on blind‑box distribution to drive collector engagement. Labubu aligns perfectly with these models: it is a globally trending character with strong emotional appeal, multiple personalities from The Monsters universe, and a wide range of colors, styles, and accessories. The blind‑box format would translate seamlessly into LEGO’s system, creating anticipation and emotional engagement at the point of purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Development and production**\n",
    "\n",
    "From a production perspective, LEGO would not need to introduce new colors for this collaboration. Labubu’s palette of earthy tones (brown, beige, green, blue, red, yellow) fits neatly within LEGO’s 2025 color system, particularly those used in nature and forest themes. Existing brick inventory covers most structural requirements, with only a few custom elements, such as Labubu’s signature ears, requiring new molds. This minimizes production complexity while maximizing creative potential.\n",

    "Both BrickHeadz and Minifigure Series demonstrate strong value growth and high collector engagement. BrickHeadz has nearly twice the total value increase, highlighting its long-term collectibility and making it well-suited for design-driven collaborations like Labubu. With fewer sets and a more exclusive themes, BrickHeadz stands out as a platform for limited editions. In contrast, Minifigure Series has been active since 2010, with a vast number of sets and minifigures, making it ideal for broad distribution and sustained demand. Both themes rank among the most owned, confirming their market relevance and deep connection with the collector community. \n",

    "BrickHeadz and Minifigure Series both show strong value appreciation, but follow distinct growth patterns. BrickHeadz exhibits sharp spikes, peaking in 2023 as the fastest-growing theme (+19.15%, #1), highlighting its potential for short-term surges and exclusive collector interest. Minifigure Series, on the other hand, demonstrates steady and accelerating growth year over year, culminating in 2024 with the highest annual increase across all themes (+20.81%, #1). This suggests that BrickHeadz is well-suited for limited, design-driven releases with viral appeal, while Minifigure Series offers a reliable platform for broad distribution and long-term market engagement.\n",
